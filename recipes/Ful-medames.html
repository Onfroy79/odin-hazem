        <p>Ful medames (Arabic: فول مدمس, fūl midammis IPA: [fuːl meˈdammes]; other spellings include ful mudammas and foule mudammes), or simply fūl, is a stew of cooked fava beans served with olive oil, cumin, and optionally with chopped parsley, garlic, onion, lemon juice, chili pepper and other vegetables, herbs, and spices.[3] Ful medames is traditionally made in and served out of a large metal jug.[4] It is notably a staple food in Egypt and is considered a national dish,[4] especially in the northern cities of Cairo and Gizah.[citation needed] Fava beans can sometimes be also found in other cuisines in the Middle East, and Africa, though cooked differently.</p>

        <h3>how to make Ful-medames step by step</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Heat, mash and season fava beans
            Remember, you are starting with canned or already cooked fava beans. Drain fava beans and place in a deep skillet or saucepan. Heat over medium-high heat with about ½ cup of water. Season with a little kosher salt and ground cumin (cumin adds depth here, but it also helps digestion.)  Remove from heat.
            
            Using your potato masher or the back of a fork, mash the beans (you don't have to mash every single bean, but just do your best to mash them some so they're nice and soft)</li>
            <li>Add spicy lemon-garlic sauce and extra virgin olive oil 
                Using a mortar and pestle, smash garlic and green chili peppers. Add lemon juice and mix</li>
            <li>Add fresh toppings
                Top the foul mudammas with fresh parsley, diced tomatoes, and a few slices of hot peppers, if you like. Serve with a side of warm pita bread (see more about how to serve it below.)</li>
