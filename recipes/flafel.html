    <h1>flafel recipe:</h1>
    <p>Falafel is often served in a pita, samoon, or wrapped in a flatbread known as taboon; "falafel" also frequently refers to a wrapped sandwich that is prepared in this way. The falafel balls may be topped with salads, pickled vegetables, and hot sauce, and drizzled with tahini-based sauces. Falafel balls may also be eaten alone as a snack or served as part of a meze tray (assortment of appetizers).

        Falafel is eaten throughout the Middle East, and is a common street food. Falafel is usually made with fava beans in Egyptian cuisine, where it most likely originated, with chickpeas in Palestinian cuisine,[1] or either just chickpeas or a combination of both in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria and the wider Middle East.[1][2][3] It is popular with vegetarians worldwide.[4]
        
        The Palestinian chickpea-only version of the falafel has also been adopted into Israeli cuisine,[1] where it now features prominently and is proclaimed as the country's national dish – a situation which has been lamented by Palestinians, Lebanese and other Arabs alike as amounting to cultural appropriation</p>

    <h3>how to make flafel step by step</h3>

    <ol>
       <li> Soak chickpeas for 24 hours. Cover them in plenty of water and add baking soda
         to help soften them as they soak. The chickpeas will at least double in size as they soak. Drain very well.</li>



        <li>Make mixture. Add chickpeas, fresh herbs (parsley, cilantro, and dill), garlic, onion, and spices to food processor and pulse a little bit at a time until the mixture is finely ground. You’ll know it’s ready when the texture is more like coarse meal.

            <strong>& Refrigerate (important.)</strong> Transfer the falafel mixture to a bowl, cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight. The chilled mixture will hold together better, making it easier to form the falafel patties.
            
            </li>  
       <li>Form patties or balls. Once the falafel mixture has been plenty chilled, stir in baking powder and toasted sesame seeds, then scoop golf ball-sized balls and form into balls or patties (if you go the patties route, do not flatten them too much, you want them to still be nice and fluffy when they're cooked.)</li>
       <li>Fry. Frying is the traditional way to cook falafel and yields the most authentic and best result. Heat the oil on medium-high until it bubbles softly (your oil should be hot enough around 375 degrees F, but not too hot that it causes the falafel to fall apart.)

        Carefully drop the falafel in the oil, using a slotted spoon, and fry for 3-5 minutes until medium brown on the outside. Avoid over-crowding the falafel; fry them in batches if necessary.</li>

    </ol>
